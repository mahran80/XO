The provided code appears to implement a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player competes against a computer-controlled bot. Here's a brief description of how the code works:

1. The `board` dictionary represents the Tic-Tac-Toe board, where each key corresponds to a position on the board, and the value represents the current mark ('X' or 'O') at that position.

2. The `printBoard()` function displays the current state of the board.

3. The `spaceIsFree()` function checks if a given position on the board is empty.

4. The `checkDraw()` function verifies if the game has ended in a draw by checking if there are any remaining empty positions on the board.

5. The `checkForWin()` function checks for winning conditions by examining all possible winning combinations on the board.

6. The `checkWhichMarkWon()` function determines if a specific mark ('X' or 'O') has won the game by checking all winning combinations.

7. The `insertLetter()` function is responsible for placing a mark ('X' or 'O') on the board at the specified position. It also checks for a win or draw after each move.

8. The `playerMove()` function prompts the player to enter their move and calls `insertLetter()` to place their mark on the board.

9. The `compMove()` function implements the bot's move by using a variant of the minimax algorithm. It evaluates all possible moves and selects the one with the highest score.

10. The `minimax()` function recursively evaluates the board positions and assigns scores based on the outcome of the game. It uses the `checkWhichMarkWon()` and `checkDraw()` functions to determine the score.

11. The main game loop executes `compMove()` and `playerMove()` alternately until the game ends with a win condition.
